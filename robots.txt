# seriously... what do you think you will find here??
# 
# anyways, since you are here, let me tell you a story..
#
# Once upon a time, in the middle of a heated CTF, there was this guy or a girl depends, lol.
# He thought he was 1337 enough to "hack" my GitHub repo.
# He spent HOURS fuzzing, bruteforcing, inspecting every pixel of the webapp,
# thinking the secret would magically pop out.
#
# Meanwhile... the actual solution was one Google search away.
# My GitHub profile was literally public.
#
# All he had to do was:
#   AHAHAHAHA you think that i will give you the solution easily??
#   wait untill the end of the compettition while we go through the write up ill explain it 
#  whats comming next is real and serious you could have done that :)
# In less than 2 minutes, you would’ve had every flag,
# a guaranteed first place on the scoreboard,
# and maybe even win a free coffee ☕
#
# But instead, you wasted your time here, 
# 
#
# Moral of the story?
# go back to the Challenges and start digging.and BTW, Google is OP. Linux is OP.
# Work smarter, not harder :)
